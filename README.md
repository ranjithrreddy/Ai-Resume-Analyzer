1. Tech Stack Used

React – For building the user interface using reusable components.

React Router v7 – For handling navigation and routing between pages.

TypeScript – For adding static typing and improving code quality.

Tailwind CSS – For creating a responsive and modern UI design.

Puter.js – For authentication, storage, and AI integration directly in the browser.

Zustand – For lightweight and efficient state management.

Vite – For fast development server and optimized production builds.

2. How the App Works

Users can sign in securely using browser-based authentication via Puter.js.

Once logged in, users can upload their resumes directly through the app interface.

The uploaded resumes are stored safely using Puter’s cloud storage.

Users can then analyze their resumes by entering a job description or uploading one.

The AI model evaluates the resume and returns:

An ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score.

Detailed feedback on strengths, weaknesses, and keyword alignment.

The entire process runs client-side, so there’s no backend setup or server dependency.
